The purpose of this application is to allow the user to have a better experience controlling the DNSCrypt Proxy on Windows.

It is targeted at .NET 2.0 to reach a wider audience, and is built on Visual Studio 2010.
Executables can be found in the /binaries directory. Unless you have issues, use the Release binary.

It was primarily created because the proxy cannot run in the background yet, so I needed a way to minimize it out of sight. The application can do the following:
Enable DNSCrypt on multiple adapter via a checkbox
Specify a TCP port to use instead of UDP 53
Start/Stop the DNSCrypt proxy

When a box is unchecked or the application is closed, all DNS server settings are reverted to their original state. This is so that browsing doesn't break if the proxy isn't restarted on the next system start. The "(Automatic)" marker appears if no DNS servers were assigned and they are provided by the router/ISP.

Possible future plans:
Have a background worker periodically check that the proxy application hasn't crashed.
Pick up a few of the other parameters that the proxy accepts
Filter out junk adapaters like ISATAP, Loopback, Terado, and virtual mini-ports
